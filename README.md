# AI_lip-sync
#### The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate your skills in creating an AI model that is proficient in lip-syncing i.e. synchronizing an audio file with a video file. Your task is to ensure the model is accurately matching the lip movements of the characters in the given video file with the corresponding audio file.
### Video - https://openinapp.co/5cwva
### Audio - https://openinapp.co/o9vuj

First,clear any existing data in the /content/sample_data directory.
Then, create a new directory to store your project data.
#### Cloning a Repository:
fetching the code and resources needed for your project from a GitHub repository called "Wav2Lip."

####Downloading a Pre-trained Model:
Retrieving a pre-trained machine learning model from the internet.
This model is essential for your project, likely used for a specific task like lip-syncing.

#### Installing Dependencies:
project has specific software requirements.
installing these requirements using pip, which is a Python package manager.
These dependencies include libraries and tools necessary for your project to work correctly.

#### Downloading a Face Detection Model:
obtaining another pre-trained model specifically designed for face detection.
This model is likely used to identify and track faces in videos.

#### Installing Additional Packages:
adding more software packages to your environment.
These packages include tools for working with multimedia files (videos and audio).

U### ploading Data:
move to a directory called sample_data.
use a Google Colab feature to upload data files interactively.
This step is essential for providing the input data needed for your project.

#### Running Inference (Making Predictions):
execute a Python script (inference.py) that performs some kind of analysis or processing.
This script likely takes the uploaded data, applies the pre-trained models, and generates a result.
In your case, it's probably related to lip-syncing.

#### Displaying and Downloading Results:
display the output video generated by your project using HTML.
provide a way to download this output video for further use or analysis.
